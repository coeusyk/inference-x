## Initial decisions

### DEC-001
- Date: 2026-06-07
- Status: accepted
- Context: The project needs a clear first milestone and must remain incremental.
- Decision: Start with one vLLM-backed OpenAI-compatible chat completions API before adding routing, observability, or UI.
- Consequences: Early progress stays measurable and later phases can build on a stable contract.

### DEC-002
- Date: 2026-06-07
- Status: accepted
- Context: Development is happening on Windows, while vLLM requires Linux tooling.
- Decision: Standardize local development on WSL2 Ubuntu and treat it as the primary runtime environment.
- Consequences: Commands, setup steps, and scripts should target Linux inside WSL2 first.

### DEC-003
- Date: 2026-06-07
- Status: accepted
- Context: The repo must support agent-assisted development in Cursor.
- Decision: Use `.cursor/rules/` for persistent repository guidance and keep the rules split by concern.
- Consequences: Repo-level instructions remain concise and easier for the editor to apply consistently.
