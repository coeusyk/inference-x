# Platform Specification Delta — add-engine-driver-thread

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Stable API-first platform
The system SHALL expose stable HTTP interfaces before layering on optional
capabilities, and non-streaming chat completions SHALL support the same
continuous-batching concurrency as streaming completions without dropping or
corrupting any in-flight request's output.

#### Scenario: Concurrent non-streaming requests
- WHEN 2 or more non-streaming chat completion requests are in flight against the
  same loaded model at the same time
- THEN every request completes with its own, complete, non-truncated output
- AND no request's terminal output is discarded or delivered to a different
  request

#### Scenario: Engine driver failure
- WHEN the shared per-engine driver thread's call into the underlying inference
  engine raises an exception
- THEN every request currently in flight against that engine receives that
  exception instead of hanging indefinitely
- AND the engine is reported unhealthy so new requests are not accepted by a dead
  driver

#### Scenario: Change is applied
- WHEN this change is applied
- THEN `POST /v1/chat/completions` request/response contracts are unchanged for
  both streaming and non-streaming callers
- AND all existing unit tests continue to pass unchanged
