# Platform Specification

## Purpose

InferenceX is a self-hosted inference platform that exposes a stable API for LLM serving and grows incrementally from a single vLLM-backed engine into a more complete system with routing, observability, and evaluation support.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Stable API-first platform
The system SHALL expose stable HTTP interfaces before layering on optional
capabilities, and non-streaming chat completions SHALL support the same
continuous-batching concurrency as streaming completions without dropping or
corrupting any in-flight request's output.

#### Scenario: Concurrent non-streaming requests
- WHEN 2 or more non-streaming chat completion requests are in flight against the
  same loaded model at the same time
- THEN every request completes with its own, complete, non-truncated output
- AND no request's terminal output is discarded or delivered to a different
  request

#### Scenario: Engine driver failure
- WHEN the shared per-engine driver thread's call into the underlying inference
  engine raises an exception
- THEN every request currently in flight against that engine receives that
  exception instead of hanging indefinitely
- AND the engine is reported unhealthy so new requests are not accepted by a dead
  driver

#### Scenario: Change is applied
- WHEN this change is applied
- THEN `POST /v1/chat/completions` request/response contracts are unchanged for
  both streaming and non-streaming callers
- AND all existing unit tests continue to pass unchanged

### Requirement: Incremental architecture
The system SHALL support additive growth without requiring large structural rewrites.

#### Scenario: New capability is added
- **WHEN** routing, observability, or a playground feature is introduced
- **THEN** the existing API contract remains stable unless explicitly versioned
- **AND** the new capability is added within the appropriate module boundary

#### Scenario: Later features are planned
- **WHEN** routing or observability work begins
- **THEN** the existing engine interface remains the default abstraction boundary
- **AND** route handlers remain thin

### Requirement: WSL2-first development
The system SHALL assume local development on WSL2 Ubuntu for Linux-only runtime components.

#### Scenario: Developer setup
- **WHEN** local setup instructions are followed
- **THEN** the runtime path targets Linux tooling inside WSL2
- **AND** Windows-native execution is not required for vLLM-bound components

### Requirement: Spec-driven changes
The project SHALL track non-trivial work through OpenSpec change artifacts.

#### Scenario: New feature is proposed
- **WHEN** a non-trivial feature or refactor is requested
- **THEN** a change folder is created under `openspec/changes/`
- **AND** the proposal, design, and task artifacts are completed before implementation proceeds
